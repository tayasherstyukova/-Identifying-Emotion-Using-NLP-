Topic: 
In this project, we aim to classify strings of text into predetermined emotion categories. We will use publicly available data from 
Kaggle (link found here: [Kaggle Emotions Dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp/data)) 
and measure success by classification accuracy. To assess the utility of the emotion labels in the dataset, we will perform a variety 
ofclustering techniques on the unlabeled data and compare the cluters to the provided labels. This work will provide insights into
typical emotions present in text strings and their salience, the validity of various emotion labels, and the algorithms best-suited for
classification of individual emotions.
